# Mini Shell

This project is a mini shell assignment I worked on during my second semester at Northeastern University. This shell supports all basic operations/commands such
as changing directories, ls and pwd commands. It also supports single pipe commands. Enjoy using it! If you have any suggestions and tips, let me know!
